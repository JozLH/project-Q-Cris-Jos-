Q: Where is Project Q getting the quotes from?
A: https://pprathameshmore.github.io/QuoteGarden/

Q: Why my language is not recognized automatically?
A: We aim offer a fluid motivational quote experience by recognizing your device language on load, however, if your device is using a locale that is not supported by the NMT engine, then Project Q is unable to recognize it automatically, and thus the quote can't be translated on load. 
Example: Project Q will recognize EUES on your device and translate the quote into Spanish; however, Project Q can't recognize MXES or LATAMES. If you have MXES or LATAMES on your device and want to get your quote in Spanish, select Spanish in the dropdown menu.

Q: I am using a compatible language, like EUES, but my language is not recognized automatically, why?
A: Some browsers, like Safari, have special requirements and restrictions in regard to accessing usersâ€™ data, like their device language.  A Chromium-based browser, like Chrome or Brave, will recognize a compatible language, like EUES or Chinese (simplified).

Q: I want to access Project Q every morning from my mobile phone. Do you have an app?
A: We don't have a downloadable app, but you can add Project Q to your home screen just like an app. In Safari, open the share sheet (tap the + symbol in bottom bar) and select Add to home. You'll now be able to access Project Q from your home page, just like an app.

If I add Project Q to my home screen, can I get quotes without Internet?
No. Retreiving and translating quotes require an Internet connection.
